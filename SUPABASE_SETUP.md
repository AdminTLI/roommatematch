# Supabase Database Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the complete Roommate Match database schema in your Supabase project.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Project**: You need an active Supabase project
2. **Access**: You need access to the Supabase SQL Editor
3. **Credentials**: Have your Supabase project URL and service role key ready

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Access Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

### 2. Enable Required Extensions

First, ensure the required extensions are enabled:

```sql
-- Enable required extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "vector";
```

If you get an error about the `vector` extension, you may need to enable it from the Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Database → Extensions
2. Find "vector" and click "Enable"

### 3. Execute the Complete Schema

1. Copy the entire contents of `db/setup/01_complete_schema.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute

**Expected Result**: This should create all tables, indexes, triggers, functions, policies, and storage buckets without errors.

### 4. Add Seed Data

1. Copy the contents of `db/setup/02_seed_demo_data.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute

**Expected Result**: This will create sample universities, programs, questionnaire items, and housing listings.

### 5. Host Demo User Data

**Important**: The demo user data is commented out in the seed file because it requires the actual user ID from Supabase Auth.

#### Option A: Create Demo User via API (Recommended)
Use the seeding API endpoint we created:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "x-seed-token: YOUR_ADMIN_SEED_TOKEN" \
  https://your-app.vercel.app/api/admin/seed-demo-user
```

#### Option B: Create Demo User Manually
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Email: `demo@account.com`
4. Password: `Testing123`
5. Check "Auto Confirm User"
6. Click "Create user"

#### Option C: Add Demo User Data Manually
After creating the demo user:

1. Get the user ID:
```sql
SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo@account.com';
```

2. Replace `[DEMO_USER_ID]` in `db/setup/02_seed_demo_data.sql` with the actual ID
3. Uncomment and run the demo user INSERT statements

### 6. Verify Setup

1. Copy the contents of `db/setup/03_verify_setup.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute

**Expected Results**:
- All extensions installed
- All custom types created
- All tables created (50+ tables)
- All indexes created
- All RLS policies active
- All triggers functional
- Vector extension working
- Seed data present

### 7. Test the Setup

#### Test Demo User Login
1. Go to your app's sign-in page
2. Use credentials: `demo@account.com` / `Testing123`
3. Should successfully log in

#### Test Database Queries
Run these test queries in the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test 1: Check if demo user can be found
SELECT u.id, u.email, p.first_name, p.verification_status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'demo@account.com';

-- Test 2: Check questionnaire responses
SELECT qi.section, qi.key, qi.type, r.value
FROM responses r
JOIN question_items qi ON r.question_key = qi.key
JOIN auth.users u ON r.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'demo@account.com'
ORDER BY qi.section, qi.key;

-- Test 3: Check housing listings
SELECT title, city, rent_monthly, status
FROM housing_listings
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Test 4: Check universities and programs
SELECT u.name as university, p.name as program, p.degree_level
FROM universities u
JOIN programs p ON u.id = p.university_id
WHERE p.active = true
ORDER BY u.name, p.name;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Vector Extension Error
**Error**: `extension "vector" does not exist`

**Solution**: 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Database → Extensions
2. Find "vector" and click "Enable"
3. Wait for it to be enabled
4. Re-run the schema

#### 2. Permission Errors
**Error**: `permission denied for table/function`

**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're using the correct Supabase project
- Check that you have admin access to the project
- Try running queries one section at a time

#### 3. Foreign Key Constraint Errors
**Error**: `insert or update on table violates foreign key constraint`

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're running the schema in the correct order
- Check that referenced tables exist before creating dependent tables
- The schema file is already in the correct order

#### 4. RLS Policy Errors
**Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy`

**Solution**: 
- This is normal behavior - RLS policies are working correctly
- Use the service role key for administrative operations
- For user operations, ensure the user is authenticated

#### 5. Demo User Not Found
**Error**: Demo user login fails

**Solution**: 
1. Verify the user was created in Supabase Auth
2. Check that the user is confirmed (not pending)
3. Ensure the password is exactly `Testing123`
4. Check that the user profile was created
