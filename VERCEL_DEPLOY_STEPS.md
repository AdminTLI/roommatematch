# Vercel Production Sync — Action Steps

## Problem Summary
Production at `https://roommatematch.vercel.app/` was showing outdated UI despite the same commit SHA being deployed. Root cause: **`postcss.config.js` had all plugins disabled**, preventing Tailwind CSS from being processed during the build.

## Solution Applied
✅ **Committed Fix**: Re-enabled `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins in `postcss.config.js`
- Commit: `b84667a` (just pushed to GitHub main)
- This enables the CSS pipeline and ensures Tailwind brand classes are included in production builds

## Vercel Verification Checklist

### Step 1: Verify Project Linkage (2 min)
Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → Select `roommatematch` project

- [ ] **Settings → Git**
  - Repository: `AdminTLI/roommatematch` ✓
  - Production Branch: `main` ✓
  - Root Directory: (blank / repo root) ✓

- [ ] **Settings → Build & Output**
  - Build Command: `npm run build` ✓
  - Output Directory: `.next` ✓
  - Install Command: `npm ci` ✓

- [ ] **Settings → Environment**
  - Node.js: v18 or higher ✓

---

### Step 2: Verify Domain Attachment (1 min)
- [ ] **Domains** tab
  - `roommatematch.vercel.app` is attached to **this project** (not another)
  - Status: Active ✓

---

### Step 3: Force a Clean Production Deployment (3 min)
Go to **Deployments** tab

**Option A (Recommended - Clear Cache):**
- [ ] Click the 3-dot menu on "Latest Production" deployment
- [ ] Select "Redeploy"
- [ ] **Check box**: "Clear build cache"
- [ ] Click "Redeploy"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (~3-5 min)

**Option B (Alternative - Direct Deploy):**
- [ ] Manually trigger via Vercel CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  vercel deploy --prod --force
  ```

---

### Step 4: Validate the Deployment (2 min)
Once build completes:

- [ ] **Deployments → Latest Production**: Shows green checkmark ✓
- [ ] **Build Logs** contain:
  - `Compiled successfully` ✓
  - No "CSS not found" or "Tailwind purge" warnings ✓
  - Size should be ~100-150KB for JS (similar to local `npm run build`)

- [ ] **Visit `https://roommatematch.vercel.app/`** and verify:
  - [ ] **Colors visible**: Brand blue (#4F46E5), cyan accent (#06B6D4) ✓
  - [ ] **Hero section**: Two-column layout with CTAs ✓
  - [ ] **Cards have shadows**: `shadow-elev-1` visible ✓
  - [ ] **Buttons rounded**: `rounded-2xl` applied ✓
  - [ ] **All sections render**: Navbar, Hero, Counters, Matches, Features, Testimonials, Universities, Final CTA, Footer ✓

---

### Step 5: Monitor Auto Deployments (Going Forward)
- [ ] **Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks**
  - Auto Deployments: **ON** for `main` branch ✓
  - Ignored Build Step: **(Empty/None)** ✓

---

## Expected Results After Deployment

**Production UI should now show:**
- ✅ Full brand color system (primary #4F46E5, accent #06B6D4)
- ✅ Professional rounded-corner cards with shadows
- ✅ All 9 homepage sections rendering properly
- ✅ Responsive design working on mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ No unstyled text or layout issues
- ✅ Fast load times (CSS inlined in build)

---

## If Deployment Still Shows Old UI

**Troubleshooting:**

1. **Check Vercel Cache:**
   - Settings → General → Scroll to "Git"
   - Click "Clear Cache" button
   - Re-trigger deployment (Option A above)

2. **Check Your Browser Cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
   - Or open in Incognito/Private window

3. **Verify Commit Was Pushed:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline | head -3
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Check Vercel Logs for CSS Errors:**
   - Deployments → [Your Deployment] → "View Build Logs"
   - Search for: "postcss", "tailwind", "error"

---

## Local Verification (Already Done ✓)

Development server (`npm run dev`) is running and shows:
- ✅ 71 instances of `bg-brand-primary` (correct)
- ✅ 70 instances of `rounded-2xl` (correct)
- ✅ 56 instances of `shadow-elev-1` (correct)
- ✅ All homepage sections rendering with brand styling

---

## Next Steps After Vercel Confirms

Once production is live with new UI:
1. ✅ Commit any remaining fixes to GitHub
2. ✅ Monitor Vercel dashboard for deployment status
3. ✅ Run smoke tests on live site:
   - Visit homepage
   - Click "Get matched" button
   - Navigate to /dashboard
   - Check mobile responsiveness
