# Demo Data Cleanup Report

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scan Result**: PASSED - No violations detected

---

## Executive Summary

This document details the comprehensive cleanup of demo/fake data from the Roommate Match codebase. All hard-coded demo entities have been removed while preserving a single whitelisted demo account for access and testing purposes.

### Key Achievements

- ✅ Removed all fake users, profiles, and responses from database seeds
- ✅ Eliminated demo bypasses from 10+ page components
- ✅ Replaced hard-coded mock data with real database queries
- ✅ Implemented proper authentication guards and redirects
- ✅ Created automated scanning to prevent demo data from returning
- ✅ Established production and development seed scripts
- ✅ Documented whitelisted demo account and safeguards

---

## Whitelisted Demo Account

### Credentials
- **Email**: `demo@account.com`
- **Password**: `Testing123`
- **Purpose**: Single allowed demo account for testing and access

### Protection Mechanisms

1. **Environment Variables** (`env.example`):
   ```bash
   DEMO_USER_EMAIL=demo@account.com
   DEMO_USER_PASSWORD=Testing123
   ```

2. **Seed Scripts** (`db/seeds/seed.prod.ts`):
   - Idempotent upsert of demo user
   - Never logs password
   - Skips if already exists

3. **Cleanup Script** (`scripts/cleanup-demo-data.ts`):
   - Explicit skip logic for demo user
   - WHERE clauses exclude `demo@account.com`
   - Verification step confirms preservation

4. **Scanner Allowlist** (`scripts/scan-demo-data.ts`):
   - Exact match for `demo@account.com`
   - Prevents false positives in CI

### 4. Scripts & Utilities

#### Created Files:
1. **`scripts/cleanup-demo-data.ts`**
   - Purges fake users while preserving whitelisted demo account
   - Interactive confirmation prompt
   - Comprehensive deletion of related entities
   - Verification step confirms demo user preservation

2. **`scripts/scan-demo-data.ts`**
   - Scans codebase for suspicious patterns
   - Detects: lorem ipsum, fake names, demo references, test emails
   - Allowlist for legitimate uses (demo@account.com)
   - Fails CI if violations found (exit code 1)

3. **`db/seeds/seed.prod.ts`**
   - Production seed with system data only
   - Creates whitelisted demo user
   - Idempotent and safe

4. **`db/seeds/seed.dev.ts`**
   - Development-only mock data
   - Guarded by environment check
   - Never runs in production

#### Updated Files:
- **`package.json`**
  - Added: `seed:prod` script
  - Added: `seed:dev` script
  - Added: `cleanup:demo` script
  - Added: `scan:demo` script

### 5. Development-Only Code Isolation

#### Created Directory: `src/devonly/`
- **`assertDev.ts`**: Throws error if imported in production
- **`mockData.ts`**: Mock entities for development
- **`README.md`**: Usage guidelines

**Purpose**: Isolate development fixtures and prevent accidental production imports

### 6. UI Components

#### Created: `components/ui/empty-state.tsx`
- Reusable empty state component
- Used when no data exists (chats, matches, listings)
- Includes icon, title, description, and optional action button

---

## Zero-State Behaviors

### Chats Page
- **Before**: Showed 3 hard-coded demo chats
- **After**: Fetches from database, shows "No conversations yet. Start a new chat" if empty

### Matches Page
- **Before**: Demo bypass allowed access without authentication
- **After**: Requires auth → onboarding → verification, then shows real matches or empty state

### Housing Page
- **Before**: Displayed mock listing with fake data
- **After**: Queries `housing_listings` table, shows empty state if no listings

### Dashboard
- **Before**: "Welcome back, Demo User!" with fake metrics
- **After**: "Welcome back!" with real user data, prompts onboarding if incomplete

### Admin Dashboard
- **Before**: Mock reports with fake names
- **After**: Empty reports array, will load from database

---

## Environment Variables

### Added to `env.example`:
```bash
# Whitelisted Demo Account (preserved during cleanup operations)
DEMO_USER_EMAIL=demo@account.com
DEMO_USER_PASSWORD=Testing123

# Development seed data (set to true only in local development)
ALLOW_DEV_SEED=false
```

### Usage:
- **Production**: Set `DEMO_USER_EMAIL` and `DEMO_USER_PASSWORD` in Vercel/deployment
- **Development**: Set `ALLOW_DEV_SEED=true` in `.env.local` to enable dev seeds

---

## Skip Logic Locations

### Where Demo User is Preserved:

1. **`db/seeds/seed.prod.ts`** (lines 100-150)
   - Checks if demo user exists before creating
   - Uses `DEMO_USER_EMAIL` env var

2. **`scripts/cleanup-demo-data.ts`** (lines 50-70)
   - Identifies demo user by email
   - Excludes from deletion queries
   - Verification step confirms preservation

3. **`scripts/scan-demo-data.ts`** (line 30)
   - Allowlist array includes `demo@account.com`
   - Prevents false positives

---

## CI/CD Integration

### Automated Scanning

**Script**: `npm run scan:demo`

**Runs**: On every push/PR (recommended)

**Detects**:
- Lorem ipsum placeholder text
- Fake names (John/Jane Doe)
- Sample/test user references
- Example email addresses
- Fake image URLs (picsum, placekitten)
- Demo chat references
- Seed data comments

**Exit Codes**:
- `0`: Clean, no violations
- `1`: Violations found, fails CI

### GitHub Actions Example:
```yaml
name: Demo Data Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run scan:demo
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add ESLint Rule**:

   - Enforce via pre-commit hook

2. **Expand Scanner Patterns**:
   - Add project-specific patterns as needed
   - Update allowlist for legitimate exceptions

3. **Database Constraints**:
   - Add CHECK constraints to prevent obvious fake data
   - Example: `CHECK (email NOT LIKE '%@test.%')`

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Alert if demo user is deleted
   - Track demo user login attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns in production

5. **Documentation**:
   - Keep this report updated with changes
   - Document any new demo data patterns
   - Update verification checklist
