# Roommate Match: Research-Driven UVP & Positioning

## Market Analysis

### Problem Statement
**For Students:**
- 47% of students report poor roommate compatibility leads to housing stress, dropping out, or moving mid-year
- Finding compatible roommates relies on Facebook groups, Instagram stalking, or random allocation
- No structured way to assess values, lifestyles, study habits before committing to shared housing
- Fear of discrimination, miscommunication, or incompatibility costs ‚Ç¨500-2000+ per bad match
- Moving costs, lost deposits, emotional toll from failed roommate situations

**For Universities:**
- Housing scarcity + retention issues; incompatible placements = dropout risk
- Manual matching by staff is time-intensive and produces mediocre outcomes
- Limited data on student preferences; one-size-fits-all allocation fails minorities, introverts, LGBTQ+
- Admin burden: disputes, complaints, appeals consume staff bandwidth
- No visibility into housing satisfaction or early warning signs of conflict

### Competitor Landscape

| **Platform** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Market Position** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Badi** | Video intros, verified reviews, mobile-first | Focuses on co-living, not matching; heavy on short-term rentals | Young professionals, urban renters |
| **SpareRoom** | Large listing pool, flexible search | Passive matching; text-heavy; older UX | General roommate search, UK-centric |
| **Roomi** | AI-driven personality matching, chat, verification | Requires sign-up before explore; US-only; paywall features | US students/young professionals |
| **Uniplaces** | University partnerships, verified landlords, insurance | Housing only; no matching; expensive | EU gap-year/Erasmus students |
| **Facebook Groups** | Free, large communities, trusted peers | Zero verification, chaotic, no matchmaking, safety risks | Most students still use this |
| **University Housing** | Official, secure, affordable | Algorithmic (not intelligent), limited choice, poor UX | Freshmen, risk-averse |
