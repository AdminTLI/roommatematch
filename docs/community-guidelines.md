# Domu Match Community Guidelines

## 1. Purpose of These Guidelines

Domu Match exists to help **students and young people find safe, compatible roommates and shared housing**.  
These Community Guidelines explain **how you are expected to behave on the platform**, what is **not allowed**, and how we **keep everyone safe**.

By using Domu Match, you agree to follow these guidelines in **your profile, messages, listings, matches, forums, and any other feature** of the platform.

If you do not agree, you must stop using Domu Match and delete your account.

## 2. Who Domu Match Is For (Intended Use)

Domu Match is designed **solely** for:

- **Students and young people** looking for:
  - Long‑term or medium‑term shared accommodation
  - Compatible roommates or flatmates
  - A room in an existing household or a person to join a new one
- **Landlords/lease holders** who are legitimately seeking **roommates/tenants** for a property they control and are legally allowed to rent.

You may use Domu Match to:

- Find a roommate or shared housing that matches your lifestyle, preferences, and budget.
- Communicate safely with potential roommates or housemates.
- Coordinate legitimate and lawful housing arrangements.

You may **not** use Domu Match as a:

- **Dating, hookup, or relationship app**.
- **General social network** unrelated to housing.
- **Marketplace** for selling goods/services.
- **Platform for commercial recruitment**, multi‑level marketing (MLM), or job offers.
- **Channel for advertising** unrelated businesses, events, or services.

If your primary goal is not housing/roommate matching, Domu Match is **not the right platform**.

## 3. Core Community Principles

All behavior on Domu Match should follow these principles:

1. **Safety first**

   Treat others with courtesy. Assume good intent but set firm boundaries. No bullying, harassment, or degrading language.

  - Lifestyle factors: noise, guests, smoking, alcohol, pets, study/work schedules.
- **Respond respectfully**, even if you are not interested:

## 8. Safety When Meeting or Visiting Properties

Domu Match encourages users to follow these safety practices:

1. **Before meeting**
   - Use in‑app messaging to get a sense of the person’s behavior.
   - Ask for basic verification (e.g., university affiliation, social media profiles) if you feel comfortable.
   - Avoid sending sensitive identity documents directly (e.g., passport, national ID) unless required by a legitimate and verifiable rental process.

2. **When viewing a property**
   - Whenever possible, **take a friend or inform someone you trust** of:
     - Where you are going,
     - Who you are meeting,
     - When you expect to be back.
   - Arrange viewings in daylight or well‑lit public areas first when feasible.
   - Trust your instincts—if anything feels “off,” you can leave immediately.

3. **Payments and agreements**
   - Do not send deposits or rent before:
     - Seeing the property (in person or verifiable live video call),
     - Reviewing a written lease or agreement,
     - Confirming the person’s legal right to rent the property.
   - Be cautious of requests for:
     - Wire transfers,
     - Payment apps with no buyer protection,
     - Cryptocurrency.

4. **Ongoing safety in shared housing**
   - Establish clear house rules (guests, quiet hours, cleaning, shared items).
   - Respect closed doors and privacy.
   - If you feel unsafe at any point, prioritize leaving the situation and seeking help.

---

## 9. Off‑Platform Communication and Transactions

While it is normal to eventually move conversations to phone, email, or messaging apps:

- Keep early communication on Domu Match where **reporting and safety tools** exist.
- Be cautious if someone:
  - Immediately insists on moving off‑platform,
  - Refuses basic questions about the property or themselves,
  - Tries to rush you into decisions or payments.

Domu Match **cannot fully protect you** once you leave the platform, but violations that begin on Domu Match (e.g., initial contact, misleading listings) can still be investigated and enforced.
