      question: "How does the roommate matching algorithm work?",
      answer: "Our algorithm analyzes 40+ compatibility factors including study habits, cleanliness preferences, social activities, quiet hours, and lifestyle choices. It uses cosine similarity to predict compatibility and prevent conflicts before they start."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the free pilot?",
      answer: "The pilot includes up to 500 students, basic matching algorithm, email support, admin dashboard, basic analytics, and white-label branding. It's perfect for testing our platform with a small cohort for 30 days."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure student safety and verification?",
      answer: "Every student must complete government ID + selfie verification before accessing the platform. All chat is text-only, rate-limited, and moderated. We provide escalation paths for any concerns and work closely with university housing teams."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we integrate with our existing housing management system?",
      answer: "Yes! Our Enterprise plan includes API access and custom integrations. We can connect with most housing management systems and student information systems to streamline your workflow."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of analytics and reporting do you provide?",
      answer: "Our admin dashboard shows real-time analytics including signup rates by university, compatibility scores, dispute resolution metrics, and housing satisfaction trends. Enterprise customers get custom reporting and compliance documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can we get started?",
      answer: "Pilot universities can be up and running within 1 week. We provide complete onboarding, training for your housing team, and ongoing support. Most universities see results within the first 30 days."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if students aren't satisfied with their matches?",
      answer: "We have a satisfaction guarantee. If students aren't happy with their matches, we work with your housing team to find better alternatives. Our algorithm continuously learns and improves based on feedback."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support international students and different languages?",
      answer: "Yes! Our platform supports multiple languages and we have experience working with international student populations. We can customize the experience for different cultural preferences and housing needs."
