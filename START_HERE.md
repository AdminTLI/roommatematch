## 💡 Pro Tips from Your AI Assistant

1. **Start with GSC**: Nothing else matters until Google knows your site exists
2. **Quality over quantity**: 1 great blog post > 5 mediocre ones
3. **Be patient**: SEO takes months, not days
4. **Focus on partnerships**: 1 university backlink = 10 random backlinks
5. **Track everything**: Use GSC data to guide what content to create next
