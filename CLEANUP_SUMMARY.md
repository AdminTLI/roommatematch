## 🚀 New Scripts Available

### Production Seed
```bash
npm run seed:prod
```
Seeds system data and creates whitelisted demo user. Safe for production.

### Development Seed
```bash
ALLOW_DEV_SEED=true npm run seed:dev
```
Creates test users for local development. Never runs in production.

### Cleanup Demo Data
```bash
npm run cleanup:demo
```
Removes all fake users while preserving demo@account.com. Interactive confirmation.

### Scan for Demo Data
```bash
npm run scan:demo
```
Scans codebase for suspicious patterns. Use in CI/CD. Exit code 1 if violations found.

---

## 🔒 Safeguards Implemented

### 1. Environment-Driven Allowlist
```bash
DEMO_USER_EMAIL=demo@account.com
DEMO_USER_PASSWORD=Testing123
```

### 2. Production Seed Protection
- Idempotent upsert of demo user
- Never logs password
- Skips if already exists

### 3. Cleanup Script Safeguards
- WHERE clauses exclude demo user email
- Verification step confirms preservation
- Interactive confirmation prompt

### 4. Scanner Allowlist
- Exact match for `demo@account.com`
- Prevents false positives
- Fails CI if violations found

### 5. Development Guard
- `assertDev.ts` throws error in production
- `ALLOW_DEV_SEED` env check
- Never runs dev seeds in production

## 🎯 Zero-State Behaviors

### Before → After

**Chats**:
- ❌ 3 hard-coded demo chats
- ✅ Real DB query → "No conversations yet" if empty

**Matches**:
- ❌ Demo bypass allowed unauthenticated access
- ✅ Auth required → Real matches or "Complete your profile"

**Housing**:
- ❌ Mock listing with 135 lines of fake data
- ✅ Real listings query → "No listings yet" if empty

**Dashboard**:
- ❌ "Welcome back, Demo User!" with fake metrics
- ✅ "Welcome back!" with real data or onboarding prompt

**Admin**:
- ❌ Mock reports with fake names
- ✅ Empty array → Will load from database
